# Data type
In Rust, variable types are automatically inferred by the compiler based on the value stored in the variable

> **Example**
```
    let number = 10;        //integer
    let floating = 3.14;    //floating point
    let boolean = true;     //boolean
    let string = "String";  //string
    let character = 'â™€';    //character
```

**print variable**
use println! macro for print value in variable by using ```{}```
```
    let number = 10;
    println!("value in variable is {}", number)
```
Output : value in variable is 10
